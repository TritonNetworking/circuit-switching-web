This summer our group presented two new papers.  The first one,
"Towards Optical Switching in the Data Center", is a
look back at our work on circuit switching, and was presented
at HPSR in Bucharest, Romania.  The second, "Evaluating
the Performance of Software NICs for 100-Gb/s Datacenter Traffic
Control" was presented at ANCS in Ithaca New York.  This second paper
evaluates recent kernel-bypass packet handling frameworks to see how
well they support rate limiting and other packet handling primitives.
