# Helios project

Represented the first effort at building a data center interconnect by
combining optical circuit switching with electrical packet switching. We built
Helios using commercial optical switches which could only reconfigure slowly,
limiting their use for highly aggregated traffic in the network core. This
project demonstrated the feasibility of circuit switching in datacenter
networks.
