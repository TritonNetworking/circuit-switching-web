This project focuses on the design and construction of a hybrid top-of-rack
switch architecture that supports fast optical switches such as Mordia. Meeting
this challenge has necessitated predicting and shaping network demand,
resulting in a hybrid optical/electrical ToR switch. Understanding real-world
data center traffic patterns and workloads is critical to evaluating our
designs. We worked with Facebook to deploy measurement and monitoring equipment
throughout their network, including flow-level capture and packet-header
capture.
